# bootstrap-practice

This project will be my first time using bootstrap.
I will be using as much bootstrap as I can in the project

Why is the dropdown menu so complicated when the Select form is just built in?

I spent entirely too long trying to figure out how to get the triangle in the dropdown menus of the navbar through bootstrap. 
It was not too hard once I found out you cant, and have to do it manually with CSS.

I had an issue where the font awesome down carrot would not display. 
I found the importance of importing the correct version of font awesome. 

I found that Firefox's developer's tools are better for tracking down where seemingly random padding and margins are coming from. 

I found trying to add a picture in a select's dropdown menu is harder than I thought it would be. 
Changing the dropdown through the background-image is very doable, though.
